            introduction: "The Hanoi Towers is a puzzle game played with three towers (pegs) and a number of disks of different sizes, which can slide onto any tower. The puzzle starts with the disks in a neat stack in ascending order of size on one tower, the smallest at the top, thus making a conical shape. The objective of the puzzle is to move the entire stack to another tower, obeying the following simple rules:"

                headline: "Rules of the Game"
                rule1: "Only one disk can be moved at a time."
                rule2: "Each move consists of taking the upper disk from one of the stacks and placing it on top of another stack or on an empty peg."
                rule3: "No disk may be placed on top of a smaller disk."
