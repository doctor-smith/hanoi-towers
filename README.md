# The Hanoi Towers

## Running the project

Use the command line to run:

``` 
./gradlew jsBrowserRun
```

Instead of manually compiling and executing a Kotlin/JS project every time you want to see the changes you made, you can use the continuous compilation mode:
```
./gradlew jsBrowserRun --continuous
```
